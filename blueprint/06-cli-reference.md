# REPL Command Reference

## Launching the Application

```bash
gcli
# or
governance-cli
```

`gcli` launches the interactive REPL shell directly. There are no one-shot
command-line arguments — all interaction happens within the running session.

- **Status bar** — breadcrumb showing current context; updates on navigation
- **Output pane** — command results; clears and redraws on each command
- **Input line** — slash-command input; `>` prompt; text accumulates as typed

## Navigation Model

### Tracks

The application has three top-level tracks:

| Track | Description | Entry |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Project** | Navigate projects, routes, stages, components, risks | Home screen (default) |
| **Library** | Browse and manage materials, NCRM, counterions | `/library` from anywhere |
| **Admin** | Bulk imports, database maintenance | `/admin` from home only |

### Navigation Hierarchy (Project Track)

```
Home
  └── Project (selected from list)
        ├── Route Mode → (route selected from list)
        │     ├── Stage Focus
        │     │     └── Component Focus
        │     └── Risk Mode (process-level)
        └── Risk Mode (project-level summary)
```

### Arrow Key Navigation

Arrow keys are active only on **list screens** (Home, Route selection):
- `↑` / `↓` — move cursor through list items
- `Enter` — confirm selection of highlighted item
- List screens show two sections: **Recents** (last used, top) and **All** (alphabetical, below)

Everywhere else, interaction is via slash commands.

---

## Escape Navigation

- **First `Esc`** — clears the current input buffer. Displays a message:
  `[ESC] Press Escape again to return to <parent screen>.`
  If a guided prompt (e.g. `/add`) is in progress, adds:
  `Warning: unsaved input will be lost.`
- **Second `Esc` within ~2 seconds** — navigates up one level in the context stack
- **Timeout** — if the second Esc is not pressed within ~2 seconds, the message
  clears and normal input resumes
- `/home` — jump directly to the home screen from any depth

---

## Global Commands (available in all modes)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/home` | Return to the home screen |
| `/library [materials\|ncrm\|counterions]` | Switch to library track |
| `/help [command]` | Show help for all commands or a specific command |
| `/quit` | Exit the application (unsaved data guard applies) |

---

## Guided Prompts

Commands like `/add risk` enter a **guided prompt mode** where the REPL asks for
each required field one at a time. The output pane shows the form in progress;
the input line collects each answer.

Example `/add risk` flow:

```
> /add risk

  Adding risk to: Route 1.1

  Risk type [Safety / Quality / Environment]: Safety
  Risk name: Explosion hazard
  Description (optional): Pressure build-up during nitration step
  Current risk level [1-10]: 8
  Proposed mitigation (optional): Install pressure relief valve
  Mitigated risk level [1-10]: 3

  [DRY RUN / PREVIEW]
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Type    : Safety
  Name    : Explosion hazard
  Level   : 8 → 3 (mitigated)
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Confirm? [y/n]: y

  ✓ Risk created.
```

Press `Esc` twice during a guided prompt to abort without saving.
