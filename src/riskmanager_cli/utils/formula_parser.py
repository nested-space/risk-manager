"""
Molecular formula parsing helpers.

Provides lightweight utilities for extracting and formatting molecular formula
information from SMILES strings and material names, used by the
``visualization_operations`` module and the route layout engine.

Why this exists:
    RDKit is used for SMILES canonicalization and validation, but lightweight
    formula-level text formatting (e.g. subscript rendering in terminal output)
    does not require RDKit and is isolated here to keep operations code clean.

    Args:
        formula: Molecular formula string (e.g. ``"C9H8O4"``).

        equivalents.

def render_chemical_formula(text: str) -> str:
    """Render a chemical display name with stoichiometric digits subscripted.

    A digit run is treated as a subscript only when the character immediately
    preceding it is part of a formula unit — a letter or a closing bracket
    (``)``, ``]``, ``}``). Digit runs following an adduct separator (``·``,
    ``.``, ``-``), a comma, whitespace, or the start of the string are left
    full-size, because there they are multipliers (hydrate/adduct coefficients)
    or organic locants rather than atom counts.

    Examples:
        ``H2SO4`` → ``H₂SO₄``; ``(NH4)2CO3`` → ``(NH₄)₂CO₃``;
        ``K2HPO4.3H2O`` → ``K₂HPO₄.3H₂O`` (the hydrate ``3`` stays full-size);
        ``18-crown-6`` is returned unchanged.

    Why this exists:
        ``interpret_chemically`` display names are free text, so an arbitrary
        formula can appear. This rule is deterministic and never mis-subscripts
        an organic locant or a hydrate coefficient. It deliberately does NOT
        handle ionic charges/superscripts or isotope mass numbers — those are
        ambiguous to detect from free text (``-`` is also a hyphen) and are
        deferred to a follow-up. This is not a complete chemical typesetter.

    Args:
        text: The display name to render.

    Returns:
        The display name with stoichiometric digit runs converted to Unicode
        subscripts; all other characters are returned unchanged.
